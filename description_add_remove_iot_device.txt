The client intends to register a new IoT device in the network. So he makes a
request to the server with the device information (e.g. serial number, type,
brand, model). The server requests a SIM card activation to the telecomunication
provider. It waits for the successfull activation and informs the client.
The server then registers the device and associates it with the customer.
The server sends encryption keys for communicating in the 
network. The use then decides if he needs help. If he does, he sends an help
request to the server, with the date the desired date for the installation.
The server schedules a installation. A technician when the installation date 
arrives goes to the customer's house to perform the installation and marks it
as complete. If the client does not need help he will perform the instalation
on his own and inform the server that the  installation was successfully 
completed. If some reason during the installation the user has problems he will
ask the server for help.
