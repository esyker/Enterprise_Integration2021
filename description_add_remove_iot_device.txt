The client intends to register a new IoT device in the network. So he makes a
request to the server with the device information (e.g. serial number, type,
brand, model). The server then registers the device and associates it with
the customer. The server ends encryption keys for communicating in the 
network. The use then decides if he needs help. If he does, he sends an help
request to the server. The server notifies a technician and the technician is
scheduled to go to the clients house. If the technician does not come after a
week the client sends another help request. If the client does not need help
he will perform the instalation on his own and inform the server that the 
installation was successfully completed. If some reason during the
installation the user has problems he will ask the server for help.
