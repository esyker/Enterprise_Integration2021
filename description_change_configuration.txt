The client accesses the webapp (Self-Service CRM) 
where he can: add/remove an IoT device from the
network, change an iot device or service onfigurations, read an IoT device
config/state, control IoT device actions or leave the webapp. 

Requesting to add/remove a IoT device from the network will start the 
add_remove_iot_device process. This action updates the IoT device
state on the server. 

Requesting to change a device/automation configuration will result on the
configuration parameters being updated on a database, will resutl on a
message sent to the device, which will rewrite its configuration. After
completing it, the IoT Device informs the server which inform the client that
the parameter change was successful. This action updates the IoT device
state on the server.

Requesting for an IoT to take an action will result in a message sent to the
server which forwards that command to the IoT device. The device does the
action updates its state and informs the server that the action has been
taken, which then informs the client. This action updates the IoT device
state on the server.

Reading the IoT Device will send a request to the server which forwards the
request to the IoT device. The IoT device sends back the configuration and
the server sends it to the user. This action updates the IoT device
state on the server.
