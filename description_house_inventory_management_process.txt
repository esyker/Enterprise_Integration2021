There are sensors placed in fridges and shelves on the customer's house.
Everytime a product is added or removed the sensor sends a message to a server
which keeps track of each user's inventory. Whenever a product is removed the
server check for any inventory shortages od that product. If there are any the
it updates the customer's shopping list. When a product is added it only
updates the user's inventory. Every ammount of time or at a certain day/hour
of the week, the server makes an order to a shop/supermarket of the products 
in the shopping list. The shop then delivers the products to the customers
house, which then are stored in the shelves/fridge.
