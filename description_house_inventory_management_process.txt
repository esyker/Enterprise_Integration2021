There are sensors placed in fridges and shelves on the customer's house.
Everytime a product is added or removed the sensor sends a message to a server
which keeps track of each user's inventory. Whenever a product is removed the
server check for any inventory shortages od that product. If there are any the
it updates the customer's shopping list. When a product is added it only
updates the user's inventory. Peridically some time before a certain day/hour
of the week, defined by the customer the server makes an order to a 
shop/supermarket of the products in the shopping list. If the supermarket is
unable to fullfill the delivery it informs the server, which informs the client.
If it's able,it also informs the server which inform the client. The client will
wait for the supermarket to deliver the products if the products aren't there on
time, the client will inform the server the delay. The server then asks the
supermarket for the delivery state and the server forwards it to the client.
The shop eventualy delivers the products to the customer's house, which then are
stored in the shelves/fridge.
