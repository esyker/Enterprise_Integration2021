Sensors installed at the customer's house are constantly scanning the
environmnet, whether it is measuring temperature or collecting images or
measuring humidity or motion and heat signatures detection. These sensors are
constantly sending the data they collect to a server. The servers logs the
data from the sensors and analyzes it in an attempt to dettect a potential
ocurrences.  If the data doesn't display any evidence of occurrences,
the process terminates. If the suspicion level is very high or confirmed, the
server informs the client that a occurrence has been detected and calls
the emergency services. The emergency services then go to the customer's house
to see to the situation. If the suspicion level is medium or undetermined, the
server asks the client to confirm if it is a real occurrence by sending
him some information details. If the client does not dettect any anomaly, the
process terminates. If he detects, the server calls the emergeny services. In
the end, the occurrence is registered in a database table, even if it is a
false negative (i.e. the server detected a possible occurence, but it was
not considered one by the client).
