The user accesses the web site and requests the available services (Catalog).
The server
retrieves them from a database and returns them to the user. The user then
chooses the ones he is interested in. If the user is already logged in, he
sends the server the servces he chose. Otherwise, the user will have to fill a
form with personal information, send it to the server, which then registers
the new user. If the server waits more than 5 minutes to receive the chosen
services from the user the process finishes. The server then iniates the
payment process by contacting the bank services. The bank services the payment
details which then, the server forwards to the user. If the user does not pay
the process finishes. If he pays, he sends the data to server and the server
forwards it to the bank services. The bank services sends the payment
confirmation to the server and the server sends it to the user. Finally the
server associates the services with the user on a database.
